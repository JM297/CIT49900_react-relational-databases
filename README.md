## React-Redux Relational Databases

This project demonstrates React-Redux's capability to connect to a backend database, in this Firebase (a NoSQL database), and do the following CRUD operations: Create a new entry into a collection, Read from a collection and display the contents of an entry, Delete an entry from a collection. 
It does not have the ability to Update entries yet. 

This also demonstrates basic Firebase authentication.
